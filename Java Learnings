Java Objects
An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose Animal is a class then Cat, Dog, Horse, and so on can be considered as objects of Animal class.

Here is how we can create objects in Java:

className object = new className();
Here, we are using the constructor className() to create the object. Constructors have the same name as the class and are similar to methods
